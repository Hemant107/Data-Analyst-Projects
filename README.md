Weather Analysis Project
This project analyzes historical weather data to identify patterns and trends. It includes:

Data Cleaning: Removing missing or incorrect weather entries

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using graphs and statistics to understand temperature, rainfall, humidity, etc.

Trend Detection: Identifying changes in weather over time (e.g., warming trends)

Insights: Drawing conclusions like hottest/coldest days, wettest month, or weather conditions per season

Ideal for beginners learning how to work with real-world weather datasets using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn.
